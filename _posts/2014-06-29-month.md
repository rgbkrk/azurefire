As of Saturday I've been a parent for one whole month. I'm pretty sure that makes me a seasoned expert.

Really, though, as babies go she's been pretty easy on us. We've had some bad nights but she's also already slept six or seven hours at a stretch. During the day she naps and she eats and she burbles. She fusses sometimes, but not *too* much. She loves to take walks, wide-eyed and quiet and staring, and she's even starting to be marginally interested when her Dad reads to her.

I'm aware that there are half a million milestones and thresholds on the way that'll make all of our lives challenging for a while. I'm not looking forward to the whole "teething" thing, for example. So far, though, this parenthood thing is pretty nice.

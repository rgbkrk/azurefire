I'm **Ash Wilson**, a Developer Support Engineer at [Rackspace](http://rackspace.com/). Basically, that means that I help people build awesome things, build awesome things of my own, and provide support for Rackspace SDKs and APIs.

I have a particular interests in developer tooling, programming language design, making software engineering process effective without being painful, automating everything you can automate, making chat bots do silly things, and artificial intelligence.

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Hossain Mohd. Faysal's HMFAYASAL V2 theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/hmfaysal-v2-theme/) because it looks quite slick and lets me work on mobile without having to do any extra hacking around.

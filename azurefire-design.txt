= outline

layout
 - header: QOTD
about/
 - for each author, hardcoded:
  - picture
  - bio
.rss
 - query by boolean tag exp
 - current archive query sets rss <link>

Future
 - prettify rake output
 - highlight administrator comments
 - deploy to production via git push
 - deploy posts via git push
  - auto-checkout, rebake, report errors
 - local post preview
 - spaces in tags (auto-convert to -)

CSS work
 - style author/timestamp line
 - style tag list, on news/ and archive/
 - style about page
 - more space between posts
 - doublecheck .markdown styling

= rake [*]
  - use all posts to build indices [*]
   - remember next/prev slugs while building index [*]
   - use basic file-based locking to protect concurrent index modifications
